let a;
// Hoisting- variable and functions are hoisted which means there declaration is moved on the top of code


console.log(a);

// let a = 12;
// then the above line get converted into below thing
// let a;
// a = 12;

// as we know hoisting means, the declaration is moved on the top of the code
a = 12;

// that's why the output of a is undefined

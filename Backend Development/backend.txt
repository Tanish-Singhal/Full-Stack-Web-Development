		Transfer of messages to a far places
phone se data (in small packets) jata hai nearest tower par.
then vo nearest tower unn small packets ko convert karta hai elctrical signals me.
then these electrical signal travel from optical fiber (inside the ocean) to its destination
then these signal travel to the nearest tower of the destination
then the tower convert these electrical signal to small packets
then these packets will be delivered to the destination phone


		Transfer of messages in nearby places
jo request hoti hai usse tumhara ISP (Internet Service Provider) check karti hai
agar vo request valid hoti hai to vo request aage pass on ho jaati hai, otherwise vo block jo jaati hai


		Router
phone se message phele router k pass aata hai then router aage forward karta hai 
Router works on Mac Address.
router send the messages to according to their Mac Address.

phele WhatsApp issi wajh se hack hota tha, jinka bhi mac Address same hota tha, unn sabke pass message pahuch jata tha.
after end to end encryption, message abhi bhi receive hota hai but vo decrypt nhi ho pata. so the message is useless nowadays.


		Server
If any computer which is connected to internet and is programmed to receive requests and give response back is called server.


		http Vs https (secured)
it is the only protocol by which we can send send o receive message in internet.
in http => the packets which are send we can see them with the help of wifi dongle in the computer system.

To connect to a server we have ports. (closed ports and open ports) (4 digit number)
jab aap live server on karte ho, then aapko ek port milta hai.
